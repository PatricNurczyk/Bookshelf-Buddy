## Introduction
Our goal with Bookshelf Buddy is to create a simple and easy to use platform for managing and tracking reading progress. With features such as creating categories, tracking current pages in books, and setting personalized goals grants the user the confidence and organization to pursue reading as a hobby.

## User Research
Several Interviews were conducted that shed light on the diverse views and preferences each user has when it comes to tracking their book progress and activities in general. We found that users find reminders for goals demotivating, and enjoy tracking progress and being in control of organization. A common preference for tracking task progress were progress bars, drawing influence with popular tools such as the CanvasTools Chrome extension. In future development, we hope to implement and build upon our user feedback, and create motivating ways to continue to read.
